# Unity Dynamic Cube Properties

This Unity project demonstrates how to dynamically modify a cube's properties at random intervals. The cube's position, scale, rotation axis, rotation speed, material color, and opacity are all changed in real-time.

## Features
- **Random Position Changes**: The cube moves to random positions within a defined range.
- **Random Scale Changes**: The cube's scale is randomly adjusted.
- **Random Rotation Axis and Speed**: The cube rotates with a randomly chosen axis and speed.
- **Dynamic Material Changes**: The cube's material color and opacity change at random intervals.

## Requirements
- **Unity** (version 2020.3 or higher recommended)
- **Unity Recorder** (for capturing video, optional)

## Unity Cube Properties Changer

A Unity script that randomly modifies a cube's position, scale, rotation axis, speed, color, and opacity at random intervals to create an interactive and dynamic 3D object behavior.
